# Playwright Test Migration Status

## Summary
Successfully created Playwright test structure to replace puppeteer tests.

## Test Structure Created
```
e2e/
├── frontend-health.spec.ts       ✓ Working (4/4 tests pass)
├── component-interaction.spec.ts ✗ Needs fixes
├── sentry-integration.spec.ts    ✗ Needs fixes  
├── visual-regression.spec.ts     ✗ Needs fixes
├── helpers/
│   └── test-utils.ts            ✓ Created
└── screenshots/                 ✓ Created
```

## Configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Created with multi-browser support
- `package.json` - Added test scripts and @playwright/test dependency

## Test Commands
```bash
# Install browsers (needs sudo)
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/frontend-health.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run only chromium tests
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium
```

## Current Status
- ✅ **Frontend Health Tests**: All 4 tests passing
  - Homepage loading
  - SPC Dashboard navigation
  - API calls
  - Responsive design

- ❌ **Component Interaction Tests**: Need to update selectors and wait conditions
- ❌ **Sentry Integration Tests**: May need Sentry configuration in test environment
- ❌ **Visual Regression Tests**: Need baseline screenshots and proper selectors

## Next Steps
1. Fix component interaction tests by updating selectors
2. Configure Sentry for test environment or skip those tests
3. Set up visual regression baselines
4. Add more specific test cases for new features

## Notes
- Tests run against `http://localhost:3000` with auto-start dev server
- Multiple browsers configured (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile)
- Screenshots and videos captured on failure
- HTML report available with `npm run test:e2e:report`
