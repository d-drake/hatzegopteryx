# Screenshot Reorganization Summary (2025-06-28)

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Screenshot Organization Structure
Created `/fullstack-app/screenshots/` with clear subdirectories for different types of test images.

### 2. Moved Existing Screenshots
- **9 visual baseline images** moved from `/tests/visual/screenshots/` to `/screenshots/baseline/`
  - Mobile: `responsive-mobile.png`
  - Tablet: `responsive-tablet.png` 
  - Desktop: `responsive-desktop.png`, `responsive-fullhd.png`, `zoom-*.png` (5 files)
- **41 test failure screenshots** moved from `/test-results/` to `/screenshots/failures/e2e/`

### 3. Updated Configuration
- **playwright.config.ts**: Added `outputDir: './screenshots/failures/e2e'`
- **.gitignore**: Updated to exclude temporary screenshot directories

### 4. Updated CLAUDE.md
Added comprehensive screenshot organization guidelines to project memory.

## Benefits

1. **Clear Organization**: Screenshots organized by purpose (baseline/failures/debug)
2. **Version Control**: Only baseline images committed, temporary files gitignored
3. **Viewport Separation**: Baselines organized by device type
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Clear structure for cleaning up temporary files

## External Screenshots
The 80 development screenshots in `~/tmp/tests/playwright_png/` remain outside the project as they are for development/debugging purposes.
