- **Test Coverage**: Authorization tests, user management tests

### Phase 3: Advanced Security ✅
- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested
- **Features**: Security headers, rate limiting, token blacklisting, audit logging
- **Test Coverage**: Headers verification, rate limit tests, blacklist tests

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Scanning ✅
- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested
- **Features**: Security dashboard, vulnerability scanning, alert system
- **Test Coverage**: Dashboard UI tests, scanning functionality tests

## E2E Test Results

### Test Suite Summary
- **Total Tests**: 140 security-related tests
- **Test Files**: 
  - `security-auth.spec.ts` - Authentication tests
  - `security-authorization.spec.ts` - Authorization tests
  - `security-headers.spec.ts` - Security headers tests
  - `security-monitoring.spec.ts` - Monitoring feature tests
  - `security-user-management.spec.ts` - User management tests

### Manual Testing Results

Using Playwright MCP, I successfully tested:

1. **Login Flow** ✅
   - Successfully logged in with admin credentials
   - JWT token stored in localStorage
   - User info displayed in header

2. **Security Dashboard** ✅
   - Dashboard loads with health status
   - Summary metrics display correctly
   - All security scans functional:
     - Password Security Scan: 0 issues found
     - Inactive Users Scan: 0 users found
     - Privilege Audit: Working

3. **Access Control** ✅
   - Admin routes protected
   - Non-admin users redirected to login
   - Superuser-only features restricted

## Sentry Issues Resolved

### Backend Issues Fixed
1. **HATZEGOPTERYX-BACKEND-5**: Fixed SQLAlchemy JSON query syntax
   - Changed `has_key()` to proper SQLAlchemy JSON operators
   - Affected privilege escalation and unauthorized access detection

2. **HATZEGOPTERYX-BACKEND-4**: Fixed password_changed_at reference
   - Updated to use created_at for password age calculation
   - Added note for future password_changed_at implementation

### Frontend Issues Fixed
1. **HATZEGOPTERYX-FRONTEND-X**: Installed missing @heroicons/react
   - Added package to dependencies
   - Used in security dashboard UI

2. **ESLint Error**: Fixed unescaped apostrophe
   - Updated unauthorized page to use HTML entity

## Security Features Verified

### 1. Authentication & Sessions
- ✅ Secure password storage with Argon2id
- ✅ JWT tokens with proper expiration
- ✅ Token blacklisting on logout
- ✅ Session timeout handling

### 2. Access Control
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ Protected API endpoints
- ✅ Frontend route protection
- ✅ Superuser-only features

### 3. Security Headers
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff ✅
X-Frame-Options: DENY ✅
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block ✅
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ✅
Content-Security-Policy: [configured] ✅
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin ✅
Permissions-Policy: [configured] ✅
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
- ✅ General API: 100 requests/minute
- ✅ Login endpoint: 10 requests/minute
- ✅ Retry-After headers included

### 5. Monitoring & Alerts
- ✅ Failed login detection
- ✅ Registration spam detection
- ✅ Suspicious pattern identification
- ✅ Audit log tracking

## Production Readiness

### Security Checklist
- [x] Authentication system implemented
- [x] Authorization and RBAC configured
- [x] Security headers enforced
- [x] Rate limiting active
- [x] Token management secure
- [x] Audit logging functional
- [x] Security monitoring operational
- [x] E2E tests passing
- [x] CI/CD pipeline updated

### Deployment Requirements
1. **Environment Variables**
   - Set strong `SECRET_KEY` for production
   - Configure SMTP settings for alerts
   - Update CORS origins

2. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Required for HSTS header
   - Needed for secure cookies
   - Update all URLs to HTTPS

3. **Database Security**
   - Use SSL connections
   - Strong passwords
   - Regular backups

## Recommendations
