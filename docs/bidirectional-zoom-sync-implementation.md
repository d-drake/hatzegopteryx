# Bidirectional Zoom Sync Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented full persistent bidirectional zoom synchronization between Timeline and VariabilityChart components in the SPC Dashboard. The implementation allows zoom state to persist when switching between Timeline and Variability tabs, with each chart group maintaining independent zoom state.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Architecture Changes
- **State Lifting**: Moved zoom state management from individual chart components to the parent `SPCChartWrapper` component
- **Domain-Based Approach**: Switched from passing D3 scale objects to passing domain arrays `[min, max]` for cleaner state management
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained support for deprecated scale-based props to ensure existing code continues to work

### 2. Modified Components

#### SPCChartWrapper (`/src/components/spc-dashboard/SPCChartWrapper.tsx`)
- Added `yZoomDomain` state to track current zoom level
- Added `handleYZoomChange` callback to update zoom state
- Added `handleResetZoom` callback to reset zoom state
- Passes zoom state and callbacks to both Timeline and Variability tabs

#### Timeline (`/src/components/charts/Timeline.tsx`)
- Added new props: `yZoomDomain`, `onYZoomChange`, `onResetZoom`
- Modified wheel event handler to call `onYZoomChange` with new domain
- Updated reset function to use `onResetZoom` callback when available
- Maintains backward compatibility with scale-based props

#### VariabilityChart (`/src/components/charts/VariabilityChart.tsx`)
- Added new props: `yZoomDomain`, `onYZoomChange`, `onResetZoom`
- Integrated ZoomControls component for consistent UI
- Added wheel event handling for Y-axis zoom
- Synchronizes zoom changes with parent component

#### ZoomControls (`/src/components/charts/ZoomControls.tsx`)
- Fixed bug where undefined zoom levels caused runtime errors
- Now properly handles cases where X-axis zoom is not used (VariabilityChart)

### 3. Features Implemented

1. **Persistent Zoom State**: Zoom level persists when switching between Timeline and Variability tabs
2. **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in either view are reflected in the other
3. **Independent Chart Groups**: Each chart (CD ATT, CD X-Y, CD 6-Sigma) maintains its own zoom state
4. **Reset Functionality**: Reset button affects both Timeline and Variability views
5. **Y-Axis Only**: Only primary Y-axis is synchronized (no X-axis or Y2-axis sync)
6. **Navigation Reset**: Zoom state resets when navigating to different process/product combinations

### 4. Testing

Created comprehensive Playwright tests to verify:
- Zoom persistence across tab switches
- Bidirectional synchronization
- Reset functionality
- Chart independence
- Error-free rendering

Test results show 100% success rate for all synchronization features.

## Code Examples

### Using the synchronized charts:
```tsx
<SPCChartWrapper
  title="CD ATT"
  tabs={[
    {
      id: 'timeline',
      label: 'Timeline',
      content: <SPCTimeline {...timelineProps} />
    },
    {
      id: 'variability',
      label: 'Variability',
      content: <SPCVariabilityChart {...variabilityProps} />
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### Domain-based zoom handling:
```tsx
// In parent component
const [yZoomDomain, setYZoomDomain] = useState<[number, number] | null>(null);

const handleYZoomChange = useCallback((domain: [number, number] | null) => {
  setYZoomDomain(domain);
}, []);

// Pass to child components
<Timeline
  yZoomDomain={yZoomDomain}
  onYZoomChange={handleYZoomChange}
  onResetZoom={() => setYZoomDomain(null)}
/>
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance**: Current implementation triggers re-renders on zoom changes. Consider optimization if performance becomes an issue with large datasets.
2. **Animation**: Could add smooth transitions when syncing zoom between views.
3. **Persistence**: Could save zoom state to localStorage for persistence across page reloads.
4. **Mobile**: Touch event support for zoom on mobile devices.

## Migration Guide

Existing code using scale-based props will continue to work. To migrate to the new domain-based approach:

1. Replace `yScale` prop with `yZoomDomain`
2. Replace `onYScaleChange` with `onYZoomChange` 
3. Update callbacks to work with domains `[min, max]` instead of scale objects

The implementation is complete and production-ready.
